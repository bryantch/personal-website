I am a native New Yorker living in Salt Lake City, Utah. I graduated from the University of Buffalo where I majored in Industrial Engineering and Mathematics and minored in Statistics. 

I currently work as a Statistician and have in the past, been a part-time Statistics Assistant at the University of Utah Marriott Library. At the same time, I am working on an MS in Statistics at California State University, Fullerton and an MS in Finance at the University of Utah. 

Besides chilling with my cat, Marty, my hobbies include hiking, road cycling, yoga and backpacking whenever I can. I like trying new things, going to new places and just challenging myself.

Areas of Statistics I am mainly interested in include Asymptotic Theory, Computational Statistics, Causality and Sampling Methodology.
