I am a native New Yorker living in Salt Lake City, Utah. I graduated from the University of Buffalo where I majored in Industrial Engineering and Mathematics and minored in Statistics. 

I currently work as a Statistician and tutor mathematics part-time at the STEM Learning Center located on the campus of Salt Lake Community College. I hold an MS in Statistics at California State University, Fullerton and an MS in Finance from the University of Utah. 

Besides chilling with my cat, Marty, my hobbies include hiking, tennis, cycling, climbing, skiing, yoga and backpacking whenever I can. I like trying new things, going to new places and just challenging myself in general.

Areas of Statistics I am mainly interested in include Asymptotic Theory, Computational Statistics & Simulations, Causal Inference and Sampling Methodology.
