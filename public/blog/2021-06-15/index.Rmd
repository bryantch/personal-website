**Introduction**

This first post is going to be about a method of constructing Nonparametric Tolerance Intervals with a focus on it's derivation, simulation and application to real data. In particular, 


It is assumed that
for the reader

familiar with and understand
mathematical statistics


**Derivation**

$$X_1,X_2,...,X_n \sim f(x)$$ where $f(x)$ is unknown
$$X_{(1)},X_{(2)},...,X_{(n)}$$ are the order statistics while $x_{(1)},x_{(2)},...,x_{(n)}$ is the ordered sample
For a two-sided tolerance interval, we want an interval for some population, $p$ and confidence level, $1-a$, such that - 

$$P \left[ \Bigl\{ P[X \leq LL] \leq \frac{(1-p)}{2} \Bigr\} \cap \Bigl\{P[X \geq UL] \leq \frac{(1-p)}{2} \Bigr\} \right]= 1-a $$
We define $LL$ and $UL$ to be the values of the order statistics that satisfies $(F_X(UL) - F_X(LL)) \geq p$. So that means we need to find ranks, $d$ and $c$, such that $F(X_{(d)}) - F(X_{(c)}) \geq p$ which is equivalent to
