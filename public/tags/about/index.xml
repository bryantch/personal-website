      <description>I am a native New Yorker living in Salt Lake City, Utah. I graduated from the University of Buffalo where I majored in Industrial Engineering and Mathematics and minored in Statistics.
I currently work as a Statistician and have in the past, been a part-time Statistics Assistant at the University of Utah Marriott Library. At the same time, I am working on an MS in Statistics at California State University, Fullerton and an MS in Finance at the University of Utah.</description>
